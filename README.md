I read [an article](http://www.businessinsider.com/tetris-as-a-treatment-for-lazy-eye-2013-4) where tetris was used to treat lazy eye by making certain parts of the game visible to one eye and other parts only visible to the other, forcing the eyes to work together to play. I took the idea and adapted it using a pair of red / blue 3D glasses. If you have amblyopia and a pair of 3D glasses, give it a try and let me know if it helps!
